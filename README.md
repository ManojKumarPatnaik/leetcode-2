# Welcome to my leetcode solutions 
This project is a minimal collection of my solutions (in Python & C++) to leetcode problems. 

As new problems are distributed in weekly and biweekly contests, you could expect my solutions to those problems when the contests are over. 
Here, I try my best to make every solution as concise as possible, which can be used as a reference to compare against ones own solution. 

Due to the limited space, the details of the algorithms are omitted. 
The readers are encouraged to look them up. Some good resources include "Algorithms, Part I & Part II" by prof. Robert Sedgewick from Princeton University and "Algorithms" 
by prof. Tim Roughgarden from Stanford University on Coursera.
